# ResuLens: Resume Parser and ATS Score Analyzer

This project is a comprehensive tool designed to streamline the recruitment process by leveraging advanced resume parsing, skill extraction, and ATS (Applicant Tracking System) scoring algorithms. It aims to optimize how resumes are analyzed in comparison to specific job descriptions, enabling both applicants and recruiters to assess the strength of a resume with precision and clarity. 

Key features include an intelligent resume parser that breaks down the resume into meaningful components, extracting core skills and relevant information crucial for determining job-fit. The ATS score calculation provides an objective metric that evaluates how well the resume aligns with the job description, giving users a clear understanding of their candidacy potential.

Additionally, the platform offers personalized improvement suggestions, guiding users on how to refine their resumes to increase compatibility with job requirements. For a more in-depth analysis, the tool includes data visualization features, showcasing ATS score distribution and skill matching through intuitive charts and graphs. These visual analytics give a clear overview of where improvements can be made.

One of the standout features is the AI-powered Cover Letter Generator, which creates a highly tailored cover letter based on the provided resume and job description. This allows users to efficiently generate a professional cover letter that highlights their qualifications while being customized to the specific role they are applying for.
